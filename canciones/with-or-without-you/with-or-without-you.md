# With or Without You

## Letra

### Verso 1
See the stone set in your eyes  
See the thorn twist in your side  
I'll wait for you

Sleight of hand and twist of fate  
On a bed of nails, she makes me wait  
And I wait without you

### Estribillo 1
With or without you  
With or without you

### Verso 2
Through the storm, we reach the shore  
You give it all, but I want more  
And I'm waiting for you

### Estribillo 2
With or without you  
With or without you, ah  
I can't live  
With or without you

### Puente 1
And you give yourself away  
And you give yourself away  
And you give, and you give  
And you give yourself away

### Verso 3
My hands are tied  
My body bruised  
She's got me with  
Nothing to win and nothing left to lose

### Puente 2
And you give yourself away  
And you give yourself away  
And you give, and you give  
And you give yourself away

### Estribillo Final
With or without you  
With or without you, oh  
I can't live with or without you

Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh....

With or without you  
With or without you, oh  
I can't live with or without you  
With or without you
