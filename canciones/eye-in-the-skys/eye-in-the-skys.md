Don't think sorry's easily said
Don't try turning tables instead
You've taken lots of chances before
But I ain't gonna give anymore, don't ask me
That's how it goes
Cause part of me knows what you're thinkin'
Don't say words you're gonna regret
Don't let the fire rush to your head
I've heard the accusation before
And I ain't gonna take anymore, believe me
The Sun in your eyes
Made some of the lies worth believing
I am the eye in the sky looking at you
I can read your mind
I am the maker of rules, dealing with fools
I can cheat you blind
And I don't need to see anymore to know that
I can read your mind (looking at you)
I can read your mind (looking at you)
I can read your mind (looking at you)
I can read your mind (looking at you)
Don't leave false illusions behind
Don't cry I ain't changing my mind
So find another fool like before
Cause I ain't gonna live anymore believing
Some of the lies while all of the signs are deceiving
I am the eye in the sky looking at you
I can read your mind
I am the maker of rules, dealing with fools
I can cheat you blind
And I don't need to see anymore to know that
I can read your mind (looking at you)
I can read your mind (looking at you)
I can read your mind (looking at you)
I can read your mind (looking at you)
I am the eye in the sky looking at you
I can read your mind
I am the maker of rules, dealing with fools
I can cheat you blind
And I don't need to see anymore to know that
I can read your mind (looking at you)
I can read your mind (looking at you)
I can read your mind (looking at you)
I can read your mind (looking at you)
Rocking all over the world
