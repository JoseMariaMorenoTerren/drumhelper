[verso]
Hello
Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone home?

[verso]
Come on, now
I hear you're feeling down
Well I can ease your pain
Get you on your feet again

[verso]
Relax
I need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?

[estribillo]
There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship's smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're sayin'
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb

[verso]
Ok
Just a little pinprick. [ping]
There'll be no more, ah!
But you may feel a little sick

[verso]
Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working. Good
That'll keep you going for the show
Come on it's time to go

[estribillo]
There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship's smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're sayin'
When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown, the dream is gone
I have become comfortably numb
