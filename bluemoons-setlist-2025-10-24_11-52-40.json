Pudiera ser que fuera martes\nSolo se que algunas veces\nCuando menos te lo esperas\nEl diablo va y se pone de tu parte\n\nEste encuentro hay que mojarlo\nCon jarabe de litrona\nCompañeros antes de que cante el gallo\nTranquilo, tronco, perdona\nY un trago pa celebrarlo\nLos tres iban hasta el culo de caballo\n\nA una barra americana\nMe llevaron por la cara\nNo dejaron que pagara ni una ronda\nControlaban tres fulanas\nPero a mí me reservaban\nLos encantos de Maruja, la cachonda\n\nNos pusimos como motos\nCon la birra y los canutos\nSe cortaron de meterse algo más fuerte\nNos hicimos unas fotos\nDe cabina en tres minutos\nParecemos la cuadrilla de la muerte\n:: SOLO\n\nProtegidos por la Luna\nCogieron prestado un coche\nMe dejaron en mi queli y se borraron\nPor las venas de la noche\nEnróllate y haznos una\nCopla guapa de la tuyas, me gritaron\n\nMe devolvieron intacto\nCon un guiño mi dinero\nLa cadena, la cartera y el reloj\nYo, que siempre cumplo un pacto\nCuando es entre caballeros\nLes tenía que escribir esta canción\n\nHoy venía en el diario\nEl careto del más alto\nNo lo había vuelto a ver desde aquel día\nEscapaba del asalto\nAl chalé de un millonario\nY en la puerta le esperó la policía\nMucha, mucha policía",
